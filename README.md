Web Crawler For Usernames, Idea Based Off Of Sherlock But Made In C# .NET
Check Out Sherlock Here: https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock

The System Works Off Of Handling StatusCodes via HttpWebRequest/Response i.e if not 200 OK then from our list we cannot find it there

Features:
- Customizable Website List
- 79 Lines, 2 Classes
- User-Agent Spoofing
- Lightweight
- Drag'N'Drop Install


There Are A Few False Positives, However In Testing We Found They Made Us Check Out A Username We Would Not Have Checked More Often, Mostly Causing Positive Results

- Customize The Banner I Dont Care
- Do Whatever You Want Code Wise, I Will Upload That At Somepoint
